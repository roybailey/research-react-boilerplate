## research-react-boilerplate

A project generated from the `react-boilerplate` project for the purpose of
exploring a more production ready react application template.

### Motivation

- To learn about `react-sagas`
- To learn how a react application with router, redux and other frameworks is structured

### Getting Started

- `yarn`
- `yarn test` to make sure everything is still working
- `yarn start`

### Research

- DONE: Take the basic template generated from `react-boilerplate` for a spin
- DONE: Add a simple Todo Page, API and necessary wiring through `redux` and `redux-sagas` to see how to extend the application
- TODO: Remove `immutable` and replace with `immer` to improve code maintenance (and replace mix of immutable and non-immutable data in the store)
- TODO: Add both API driven filter (category) and Page driven Selector (status) on Todo Page
